## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects financial institutions and customers alike. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing financial security. The analysis explores various features of transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains various features related to credit card transactions, including the transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables resulting from PCA transformation.
